Please see the setup document "/documentation/Apprecie Development Environment Setup v005.doc" to show how to set up a Development Environment for the Apprecie Platform on a Windows 10 machine.  If defines how to both create the Runtime Environment along with Managing the Codebase connected to a GIT repository.

The Apprecie Platform is written using PHP and JQuery with a MySQL database.  It uses two frameworks to simplify development, Phalcon for server side and Angular for client side processing.

To set up the Runtime Environment this document above details: 
•	Internet Information Server (IIS) setup (Web Server Management); 
•	Web Platform Configuration for PHP including PHP Manager for IIS (Additional Web Server Management tools to enable PHP to run); 
•	Source Code Repository creation (simple file structure containing all the Apprecie Source Code).  This includes Installing Git for Windows and connecting it to the BitBucket Repository (to allow for the version control of the software) along with installing Tortoise Git (providing a UI for version control); 
•	Phalcon and Angular Frameworks (Allowing the phalcon and angular frameworks to run); 
•	Website Settings to run the appropriate portal instances;
•	MySQL Database to set up an Apprecie Database in a locally running version of MySql; 
•	Application Configuration to create a working local application; 
•	System Variable (APPRECIE_FIELD_KEY) to enable Field Level Decryption Key for Personal Information; 
•	Certificate Management for SendGrid integration (allowing for the sending of eMail via SendGrid); 
•	Assets to copy any images for existing portals;

Additional information on Apprecie can be seen on www.apprecie.com .  Details on how the application can be used will be shared in future documents, in the meantime, any questions should be sent to: info@apprecie.com
